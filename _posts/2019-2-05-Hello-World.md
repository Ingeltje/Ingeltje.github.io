##  Week 1

This first day we reflected on what biohacking is and what the Biohack Academy stands for. We got an introduction to Sketchup for 3D design, which I do not intend to use since I prefer Fusion360 because it allows for parametric design. Per Staugaard (BVF Biosafety officer) taught us how to behave safely in the lab and showed us, using UV light, that even washing hands is not trivial and needs more attention than if everyday life:

Each week we will build a device to use in a DIY lab. This week we built our first lab device: a [sterile hood](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_SterileHood). Again: quite a challenge, in particular because Ikea changed the design of the extractor fan we used as a primary filter!

In the lab we learned the basics of working sterile using alcohol to clean the working surface and a gas burner to create a sterile ”umbrella”.

We also got an introduction to laser cutting, this week’s practical assignment being the design and fabrication of a laser cut tube rack. I designed a parametric rack in Fusion 360, the parameters being the number of rows, number of columns and the tube size per row.

##  My first blog post ever

I feel really blessed to have the opportunity to be part of the [6th Biohack Academy](https://waag.org/en/article/sixth-ibiohack-academy-planned-2019) that will take place in the next 10 weeks in this beautiful building in Amsterdam:

In this blog I will document what I learn and discover as a newbie biohacker. 
To start with: I will have to learn how to resize and rotate a picture in this blog!

##  Week 2


![](/images/IMG_E1176.JPG  "MIN-MAX thermometer" )

This week we got an introduction on microbiology and analog electronics. The assignment for electronics was to make a circuit with input and output. For this I revived an Arduino-device I designed for my [Non-Scientific Arctic Weather Station](https://www.facebook.com/inger.legue/posts/10155048045464335) in Ísafjörður, Iceland (2017):  a MIN-MAX thermometer including an LCD display.

In the lab we got an introduction on cultivating microbes. We learned about (a) nutrient agar and (b) agar plates, and about (c) incubators and (d) autoclaves, aka Ikea pressure cookers.

For cultivating microbes working sterile to avoid contamination is very important: (a) use alcohol to clean the surface and (b) a gas burner to create a sterile umbrella and for next steps: (c) sterilize whatever  you use and (d) stay within the sterile “umbrella”.

For this week’s device (the magnetic stirrer) I ordered all parts and assembled the electronics. I found out the resistors got really hot while the heating pad did hardly heat up. Even after changing the power supply the problem remained.

It appeared to be a flaw in the design. The fix was to add 3 resistors in parallel and to move one of the connections, as can be seen in this updated schedule posted by Raza, a [2017 BHA student](https://github.com/R4za/BiohackAcademy2017/blob/master/stirrerschematic.png ). After changing the circuit accordingly the heating pad functioned as expected.

##  Week 1

This first day we reflected on what biohacking is and what the Biohack Academy stands for. We got an introduction to Sketchup for 3D design, which I do not intend to use since I prefer Fusion360 because it allows for parametric design. Per Staugaard (BVF Biosafety officer) taught us how to behave safely in the lab and showed us, using UV light, that even washing hands is not trivial and needs more attention than if everyday life.

Each week we will build a device to use in a DIY lab. This week we built our first lab device: a [sterile hood](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_SterileHood). Again: quite a challenge, in particular because Ikea changed the design of the extractor fan we used as a primary filter!

In the lab we learned the basics of working sterile using alcohol to clean the working surface and a gas burner to create a sterile ”umbrella”.

We also got an introduction to laser cutting, this week’s practical assignment being the design and fabrication of a laser cut tube rack. I designed a parametric rack in Fusion 360, the parameters being the number of rows, number of columns and the tube size per row.

##  Biohack Academy 2019: My first blog post ever

I feel really blessed to have the opportunity to be part of the [6th Biohack Academy](https://waag.org/en/article/sixth-ibiohack-academy-planned-2019) that will take place in the next 10 weeks in this beautiful building in Amsterdam:

In this blog I will document what I learn and discover as a newbie biohacker. 
To start with: I will have to learn how to resize and rotate a picture in this blog!

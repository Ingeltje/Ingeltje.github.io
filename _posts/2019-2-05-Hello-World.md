##  FINAL PROJECT 

“Resistence is fertile”: this was the title of my final project’s midterm presentation. 
Surprised by the complete lack of empathy for the [seedlings]( 
https://www.space.com/43012-china-cotton-seed-moon-far-side-chang-e4.html)
sent to the backside of the moon by China’s Chang'e 4 lander perishing there from cold a few hours after they sprouted …. 


![](/images/01%20cotton%20seedlings%20sprouted%20on%20the%20moon%20in%20soil%20from%20earth%20%2015%20jan%202019.jpg "Seedling")

…. as opposed to the commotion there was in the 50s about the stray dog Laika, sent into orbit around Earth by the Russians and dying in Spoetnik 2 after 7 hours from heat and stress ….

![](/images/02%20Wellerstein-Laika.jpg "Laika" )

…  I wanted to take a closer look into the distance humans apparantly perceive between themselves and other biological agents. 
Since “having brains” seemed to be a key factor for that perceived distance and hence for the level of empathy towards other biological agents, I thought showing “brain-like” activity in otherwise thought-off brainless agents  - like for instance iceberg lettuce - perhaps could change the perceived distance and make people feel more related to for instance iceberg lettuce ….
 
![](/images/03%20IcebergLettuce.png "Lettuce" )

 … that, visually, already shows a remarkable resemblance to the human brain:
 
![](/images/04%20Human%20brains.jpg "Brains" )

A common way of measuring brain activity being to make an EEG, my plan was to hook up iceberg lettuce to an EEG device and compare potential difference under several test conditions (neutral – sound of cutting iceberg lettuce – video of someone eating iceberg lettuce), comparable to doing EEG experiments with humans.
 

![](/images/05%20RLG%20P300%20experiment.jpg "EEG" )

There were still some experimental design issues to be solved, but having built EEG-based BCI systems, I was sure I would know how to do this and presented my Resistence is fertile  project at midterm:

![](/images/06%20resistence%20is%20futile%20v2.jpg "Futile" )

And then, while presenting it, I realized I indeed already knew how to do this! That was not why I joined Biohack Academy! Lucky for me Roland sympathized with my plan to completely change subject, so what follows is my Final Project version 2.0.

## Final project version 2.0: Inger’s Kitchen Sink Lab

Project description: 
A prototypical Kitchen Sink Bio Lab for both biological experiments and - in parallel -  the development of  ideas about the technical, legal and ethical questions involved in biological experiments (including genetically modification of the human genome), reformulated  as “Kan ik het”, “Mag ik het” and “Wil ik het”.

Context:
While the WHO and other national and international organizations are discussing standards for governance of intervention on the human genome, November 2018 [Dr. He Jiankui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Jiankui) (Shenzhen, China),
claimed to have made the first genetically modified people, using CRISPR Cas9 to genetically modify the genome. 

![](/images/07%20He_Jiankui.jpg "Dr He" )

March 2017 [COGEM](https://www.cogem.net/index.cfm/en), the Dutch committee that provides scientific advice to the government on the risks to human health and the environment of the production and use of GMOs and informs the government of ethical and societal issues linked to genetic modification, published [“Ingrijpen in het DNA van de mens”](https://www.cogem.net/index.cfm/nl/publicaties/publicatie/ingrijpen-in-het-dna-van-de-mens-morele-en-maatschappelijke-implicaties-van-kiembaanmodificatie).

Triggered by Dr. He’s announcement, January 2019 COGEM [updated](https://www.cogem.net/index.cfm/nl/publicaties/publicatie/update-ingrijpen-in-het-dna-van-de-mens) this publication, stating that the discussion has been accelerated and expressing concerns about the technical, legal and ethical questions that are associated with genetically modification of the human genome.

Being a human being myself, I consider the subject too important to leave it to COGEM, de Gezondheidsraad, WHO or other organizations to come up with answers.  My modus operandi being that I build and do to find out and explore, I decided to start doing my own research about the blessings and dangers of genetically modification of genomes in general and the human one in particular, by building a prototypical Kitchen Sink Bio Lab and start experimenting while in parallel developing ideas about the technical, legal and ethical questions involved, reformulated  as “Kan ik het”, “Mag ik het” and “Wil ik het”, using the IKS Lab grid as a canvas.

![](/images/GRID.png "Grid" )

Practical Set-up of the Kitchen Sink Lab
Tuesday, 26th of March 2019 I claimed a space at Wetlab Waag in Amsterdam to grow my Kitchen Sink Bio Lab in. In the weeks before  I already built several devices as per the BHA device repository, amongst which a Magnetic Stirrer, (the electronics part of) an Incubator and a Centrifuge that were the first objects I placed in the IKS Lab space. 

![](/images/08%20IKS%2001.jpg "IKS" )


To keep track of what was needed in a Kitchen Sink lab apart from the devices I built myself,  I decided that nothing could enter the IKS Lab space that was not owned by me or “borrowed” from Wetlab and then photographed/ otherwise documented (for instance by printing out purchase options) for future reference.
Sticking to that rule, in the days that followed and while doing 2 experiments (see Experiments) my IKS Lab grew step by step: 


![](/images/09%20IKS%20Lab%20combi%20pic.jpg "IKS lab" )

Experiments

To find out what the possibilities would be of such a kitchen sink lab and what limitations I would have/ barriers I would encounter, I intended to do 2 experiments:  the [Mystery Meat Experiment](http://biohackacademy.github.io/bha6/class/5/pdf/Mystery%20Meat%20Protocol%20BHA5.pdf)
we did in class 5 and the Crispr Cas 9 e.coli experiment as per the The Odin’s [DIY Bacterial Gene Engineering CRISPR Cas9 kit](http://www.the-odin.com/diy-crispr-kit/)  .  
I choose the first experiment  because being a hardcore vegetarian I really would like my Kitchen Sink Lab to be equiped for PCR tests to find out whether or not the vegetarian bamischijf at Smullers contains meat traces of the frikandel fried in the same oil a minute before.

![](/images/Bamischijfje.jpg "Bamischijf" )
The same for the HEMA vegetarian sauzijzenbroodje, in store stored next to the non-vegetarian version of it, both frequently consumed by me on my way home from Amsterdam. 

![](/images/Saucijzenbroodje.jpg "Saucijzenbroodje" )

I also choose this experiment because a lot of lab procedures and lab skills are involved that I wanted  to practise. 
Most important take-away from this part of the project: lots of consumables (primers, DNA loading dye, agarose) and small lab items (erlenmeyers, safety goggles, pipettes) are needed for a functional biolab. More importantly: it might be that some chemicals are too dangerous to be used in a kitchen sink lab (in this case: SYBR safe to colour the agarose gel is really toxic!).

![](/images/10%20Mystery%20Meat%20combi.jpg "Meat combi" )

For the second experiment I ordered The Odin’s [DIY Bacterial Gene Engineering CRISPR Cas9 kit](http://www.the-odin.com/diy-crispr-kit/) . Knowing that there is strict European regulation about  genetic editing of organisms, prohibiting to do the CRISPR Cas9 e.coli experiment in Waag’s Wetlab, my particular interest here was to find out exactly which actions in the protocol are not permitted, why these are not permitted and how this is controlled (possibly leading to minor disobedient behaviour in the IKS Lab once it would be up and running), all aimed at getting to know more about genetics, genetic manipulation, genetic manipulation on the human germline  and “standards for governance of intervention on the human genome”.


After I received the package for the CRISPR Cas9 e.coli experiment (not opened by customs; see Gate Keepers) I took it to my prototypical Kitchen Sink Lab at Waag, opened the package, and did everything that in the [manual](http://www.the-odin.com/crispr-bacterial-guide/) was labeled as Preparation,  all steps being legal and allowed according to both Waag’s safety officer Per Staugaard and our Biohack instructor Roland:
•	Make LB agar plates 
•	Streak out e. coli bacteria onto LB Agar plate 
•	Put the plates in an incubator for the bacteria to grow (easiest to just let it sit overnight)

![](/images/BoxOdin.jpg "Box Odin" )


Because both Per and Roland told me by EU regulation it is not allowed to perform step 5 (the “heatshock”)  in the manual’s next section  “DNA transformation and CRISPR experiment” I stopped the experiment. 

![](/images/12%20Heatshock%20in%20step%205.png "hetshock" )

I intend to find out more about these EU regulations, national gratification and reasoning behind strictly forbidding the CRISPR Cas9 procedure in the EU in the next few months and to report on my findings.

For the moment my way of involving more people in the subject matter consists of building the ISK Lab, doing experiments, telling people about it during the exhibition of the BHA6 Final projects on April 2nd 2019 and at that occasion ask people to think about the choices I have with regards to the CRISPR Cas9 experiment and vote:

![](/images/13%20Voting%20form.png "Voting form" )

Gate keepers?
Citizens are supposed to know the law and in general when something is forbidden by law there is a kind of control system in place to enforce the law. For instance: kids younger than 18 are not allowed to buy alcohol. People selling alcohol are the gate keepers and have an obligation to ask for proof of being 18+ when selling alcohol to youngsters.
As far as doing biological experiments I found out there basically are no gate keepers when ordering from the US.  Although the DIY Bacterial Gene Engineering CRISPR Cas9 kit I ordered from The Odin was held in customs for some time, this was only (typical Dutch!) to calculate how much VAT I had to pay. Without any notice the kit itself was just dropped off at a pickup point in a second hand store a few blocks away when I was not at home. I am not sure what to think about this.


![](/images/14%20Used%20Products.PNG "Used products" )

When ordering lab materials from Dutch companies there seems to be a gate keeper system in place though: for the DIY gelbox (needed for PCR experiments) I tried to order a platinum wire from [Sigma-Aldrich](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/nederland.html). I couldn’t do so because I did not pass the new-customer screening (delivery address being a home address and when I tried to order through my company: my company not being registered as a life sciences lab). 

Then again, ordering from the US was no problem: I ordered a gelbox including platinum wire from [iRodeo](https://iorodeo.com/collections/gel-electrophoresis-and-imaging/products/mini-gel-electrophoresis-box?variant=12388662790) and a few days later it was handed over to my 87-year old neighbour who had not a clue what it was and for days forgot to tell me he had taken delivery of it. 

##  Update: the votes are in!

![](/images/15%20The%20votes%20are%20in%20.JPG "Votes are in" )

The votes are in and counted! 
Results:
1. I think she will not do it and I also think she shouldn't do it: 0x
2. I think she will not do it, but I think she just caan do i: 2x
3. I think she will do it. but I think she shouldn't do it: 11x
4. I think she will do it and I think she can just do it: 14x (amongst which one signed by GOD).

Also one person noted she thinks I already did and one person added I should do it safely.
Which - in case I decide to do it - I surely will do.
I will keep you posted!

##  Week 6 to Week 9 (still to be documented)

![](/images/Combi%20Left%20and%20Right.jpg "DNA" )

The result of a lot of steps: DNA visible!

##  Week 4

This week was about optics. We learned how to use a microscope and how to stain tissues (here: slices of carrots and onions) to make the cell structure visible under a microscope and how to fixate these (using clear nail polish) to preserve the slides. 

![](/images/WEEK%204%201%20-%20vierluik%20microscoop.jpg "Microscope")

As a follow-up on last week’s practical assignment (where we [isolated the Lactobacillus casei bacteria](http://biohackacademy.github.io/bha6/class/3/isolation-of-yoghurt-bacteria/) 
from plain yoghurt and from the probiotic drink Yakult), I  took all agar plates out of the incubator to see what happened in a week's time.  

![](/images/Week%204%202%20-%20all%20plates.jpg "All plates") 

A way to compare bacterial growth is to count the number of colonies in comparable plates. In the -1 and -3 plates there were far too many colonies to do this.

![](/images/Week%204%203%20-%202%20plates.jpg "YO3 and Ya3 plates") 

The bacterial growth in the -5 agar plates were easiest to compare because they allowed for counting separate colonies with the naked eye. In the -5 yoghurt plate I counted 14 colonies; in the -5 Yakult plate I counted 73 colonies, hence approximately a 1:5 ratio, semi-scientifically proofing the Yakult claim to be half true. ("Half true" calculation: the Yakult claim is “at least 6.5 billion bacteria per bottle” of 65ml. Estimates for yoghurt being between 1 to 10 million bacteria per ml, which equals between 6.5 and 650 millions per 65 ml, the Yakult claims boils down to 10x more bacteria. The 5x more bacteria that I counted is only half of that.)

![](/images/Week%204%204%20-%20YO5%20plate.jpg "YO5 plate") 

Because for my final project I was contemplating the idea of making a game for slime mould and my co-student Mischa was thinking about doing something with slime mould too, we decided to do some tests to see how slime mould grows (direction & speed, the placement of food being the variable condition). For this we prepared 6 agar plates, inoculated these with slime mould and made 6 different oat patterns (= food) in the dishes.

![](/images/Week%204%205%20-%20Mischa.jpg "Mischa") 

One day later when I came back in the lab the slime mould in the bottom right dish already reached halfway the diameter. A day later it travelled all the way to the other side. I intend to show the growth next week too and where possible draw conclusions.

![](/images/Week%204%206%20%20-%204luik%20slime%20mold%202.jpg "Growth slime mould")

This week's device assignment was to build a webcam microscope. I finished mine at home and looking at a slide I already prepared in the lab, was really surprised to see the quality of the image.

![](/images/Week%204%207%20-%20webcam%20microscope.jpg "Webcam Microscope") 

With regards to the lecture on Biotic Games, showcasing amongst others [Euglena Spaceships 2016](https://waag.org/nl/article/euglena-spaceships) (Roland van Dierendonck, Christian Schulz, Pieter van Boheemen, Ingmar Riedel-Kruse ) and Raphael Kim’s [Mould Rush](https://biohackanddesign.com/portfolio/mould-rush), once again I stumbled upon the question how to think about the Euglena and slime mould "involved" in this human-microorganism interaction. 

![](/images/Week%204%208%20Biotic%20Gaming.jpg "Biotic Gaming") 

Is there any intentionality from the other side? Are humans and the microorganisms playing a game together or are the creatures just exploited as animated set pieces in a game? In my search for answers I stumbled upon Christophe Menant’s publication [Biosemiotics, Aboutness, Meaning and Bio-intentionality, Proposal for an Evolutionary Approach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279941646_Biosemiotics_Aboutness_Meaning_and_Bio-intentionality_Proposal_for_an_Evolutionary_Approach). It feels like at least I have a starting point now for further idea development!

![](/images/Week%204%209%20IMG_1231.PNG "About aboutness") 


This week’s guest lecturer was Gunter Seyfried. I really like his work, in particular his current [Return to Dilmun project](http://www.polycinease.com/return-to-dilmun/), “co-starring” our own instructor Roland and our own Waag wetlab. 

![](/images/Week%204%2010%20Return%20to%20Dilmun2.jpg "Return to Dilmin")


(Little did I know that later, unintentionally, I would hear what "Return to Dilmun" is about far more often than I wished for, me myself ending this by improvising an autocue set-up for Gunter and Roland, consisting of finger swiping pieces of text on an iPad, handheld under a camera. My autocue past and my biohack future: bien étonnés de ce trouver ensemble!)  


## And then there is this: a personal story (1).  
##

![](/images/Week3-Marion.png "May the horse live within me")

When Lucas Evers in his Week 3's lecture about Bio Art talked about Marion Laval-Lantet’s 2011 “May the horse live within me” art performance, it enraged me. Later I realized this could well be because of some unanswered questions still haunting me somewhere in the background since the early 90's.

In 1992 my brother John, suffering from [aplastic anaemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplastic_anemia) as a therapy first got blood cells from pigs and horses and later a bone mare transplant of an anonymous East-German donor. My brother died from [graft-versus-host disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease), basically his own organs one by one being rejected by the graft. I was very confused at that time and was left with very basic questions about identity. Was my brother a chimera when he got the pig and horse cells? Later, was my brother killed by the allogeneic bone mare or was the remaining entity not my brother anymore? Are we basically our immune system? 

As a personal side path I will document about these and other Biohack related questions in “And then there is this” blog posts.  For one of the question I meanwhile found this answer: yes, my brother was a [chimera](https://www.watersheddna.com/blog-and-news/stemcelltransplantgedmatch)! 

![](/images/Week3-Chimera.png "My brother was a chimera")


##  Week 3

This week we got a short introduction to molecular biology and a crash-course Arduino programming and digital electronics. In the lab we started isolating microbes ourselves. 

![](/images/Week3-Vierluik1.jpg "Isolation yoghurt")

We learned how to make Ringer’s solution (a liquid simulating the isotonic solution in bodily fluids) and MRS Agar plates (a petri dish filled with agar and nutrients that - once it is solidified - can be used to culture microorganisms).  
The agar plates were used for the [isolation of yoghurt bacteria](http://biohackacademy.github.io/bha6/class/3/isolation-of-yoghurt-bacteria/) as found in plain yoghurt and Yakult. 

We also got a lecture by Lucas Evers about Bio Art. Intrigued by the distinction we (= humans) make between inanimate material - plants – bacteria – vertibrates – other human beings, the work of [Spela Petric](https://www.spelapetric.org/) resonated most with my current questions. 

![](/images/Week3-Spela.png "Spela Petric homepage")

To find out more about this and hopefully get some answers to my questions, I decided to attend the [V2 Meetup Introduction to Bio Art](https://v2.nl/events/media-art-meetup-2-4-introduction-to-bio-art), where both Lucas and Spela would be speakers.

This week’s device to be built was the [incubator](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Incubator). Important part of an incubator: temperature sensing and adjusting temperature accordingly.

![](/images/Week3-Incubator_new.jpg "Incubator")
I breadboarded the electronics and after some initial problems all seemed to work fine. Together with Candyce the wooden enclosure was lasercut and put together. Next step to do: convert breadboarded version into soldered one and mount  everything in the enclosure. 

Thinking about a possible Final Project  (designing a game for a micro-organism seemed a logical next step after having designed games for humans and for machines) I started reading about/ watching videos about [programmable plants](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151116112702.htm), [computers made from plants](http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/34763/1/ComputersFromPlants_1702.08889.pdf), [the rights of microbes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/030801804225012635?journalCode=yisr20), [using micro-organisms in games](https://vimeo.com/261943628) and other related subjects.

![](/images/Week3-Vierluik2.jpg "Reading and watching")
 
A whole new world is opening up for me!



##  Week 2


![](/images/MIN-MAX%20thermometer.jpg "MIN-MAX thermometer" )

This week we got an introduction on microbiology and analog electronics. The assignment for electronics was to make a circuit with input and output. For this I revived an Arduino-device I designed for my [Non-Scientific Arctic Weather Station](https://www.facebook.com/inger.legue/posts/10155048045464335) in Ísafjörður, Iceland (2017):  a MIN-MAX thermometer including an LCD display.


![](/images/Week2_Composite1.jpg "Working sterile")

In the lab we got an introduction on cultivating microbes. We learned about (a) nutrient agar and (b) agar plates, and about (c) incubators and (d) autoclaves, aka Ikea pressure cookers.
 

![](/images/Week2_Composite2.jpg "Working sterile")

For cultivating microbes working sterile to avoid contamination is very important: (a) use alcohol to clean the surface and (b) a gas burner to create a sterile umbrella and for next steps: (c) sterilize whatever  you use and (d) stay within the sterile “umbrella”. 


![](/images/IMG_E1154.JPG "Magnetic Stirre Electronics")
For this week’s device (the magnetic stirrer) I ordered all parts and assembled the electronics. I found out the resistors got really hot while the heating pad did hardly heat up. Even after changing the power supply the problem remained.


![](/images/IMG_1188.PNG "Revised Magnetic Stirrer circuit")
It appeared to be a flaw in the design. The fix was to add 3 resistors in parallel and to move one of the connections, as can be seen in this updated schedule posted by Raza, a [2017 BHA student](https://github.com/R4za/BiohackAcademy2017/blob/master/stirrerschematic.png ). After changing the circuit accordingly the heating pad functioned as expected.

##  Week 1



![](/images/UVlight.JPG  "UVlight" )
This first day we reflected on what biohacking is and what the Biohack Academy stands for. We got an introduction to Sketchup for 3D design, which I do not intend to use since I prefer Fusion360 because it allows for parametric design. Per Staugaard (BVF Biosafety officer) taught us how to behave safely in the lab and showed us, using UV light, that even washing hands is not trivial and needs more attention than if everyday life.

Each week we will build a device to use in a DIY lab. This week we built our first lab device: a [sterile hood](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_SterileHood). Again: quite a challenge, in particular because Ikea changed the design of the extractor fan we used as a primary filter!

![](/images/IMG_0839_klein.jpg "Sterile Hood" )

In the lab we learned the basics of working sterile using alcohol to clean the working surface and a gas burner to create a sterile ”umbrella”.

![](/images/photo%201.JPG "Sterile Umbrella" )

We also got an introduction to laser cutting, this week’s practical assignment being the design and fabrication of a laser cut tube rack. I designed a parametric rack in Fusion 360, the parameters being the number of rows, number of columns and the tube size per row. 

![](/images/Parametric%20Tube%20rack%20klein.png "Fusion360" )

 
##  Biohack Academy 2019: My first blog post ever

I feel really blessed to have the opportunity to be part of the [6th Biohack Academy](https://waag.org/en/article/sixth-ibiohack-academy-planned-2019) that will take place in the next 10 weeks in this beautiful building in Amsterdam: 




![](/images/IMG_1357_klein.jpg "Waag, Amsterdam" )


In this blog I will document what I learn and discover as a newbie biohacker. 
To start with: I will have to learn how to resize and rotate a picture in this blog!

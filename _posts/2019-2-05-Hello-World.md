##  Week 10

![](/images/IMG_2012.jpg "The Votes" )

The votes are in and counted! 
Results:
1. I think she will not do it and I also think she shouldn't do it: 0x
2. I think she will not do it, but I think she just caan do i: 2x
3. I think she will do it. but I think she shouldn't do it: 11x
4. I think she will do it and I think she can just do it: 14x (amongst which one signed by GOD).

Also one person noted she thinks I already did and one person added I should do it safely.
Which - in case I decide to do it - I surely will do.
I will keep you posted!

The result of a lot of steps: DNA visible!

## And then there is this: a personal story (1).

When Lucas Evers in his Week 3's lecture about Bio Art talked about Marion Laval-Lantet’s 2011 “May the horse live within me” art performance, it enraged me. Later I realized this could well be because of some unanswered questions still haunting me somewhere in the background.

In 1992 my brother John, suffering from aplastic anaemia as a therapy first got cells from pigs and horses and later a bone mare transplant of an anonymous East-German donor. My brother died from graft-versus-host disease, basically his own organs one by one being rejected by the graft bone mare. I was very confused at that time and was left with very basic questions about identity. Was my brother a chimera when he got the pig and horse cells? Later, was my brother killed by the allogeneic bone mare or was the remaining entity not my brother anymore? Are we basically our immune system? 

As a personal side path I will document about these and other Biohack related questions in “And then there is this” blog posts.  For one of the question I meanwhile found this answer: yes, my brother was a [chimera](https://www.watersheddna.com/blog-and-news/stemcelltransplantgedmatch)!

##  Week 3

This week we got a short introduction to molecular biology and a crash-course Arduino programming and digital electronics. In the lab we started isolating microbes ourselves. 

![](/images/Week3-Vierluik1.jpg "Isolation yoghurt")

We learned how to make Ringer’s solution (a liquid simulating the isotonic solution in bodily fluids) and MRS Agar plates (a petri dish filled with agar and nutrients that - once it is solidified - can be used to culture microorganisms).  
The agar plates were used for the [isolation of yoghurt bacteria](http://biohackacademy.github.io/bha6/class/3/isolation-of-yoghurt-bacteria/) as found in plain yoghurt and Yakult. 

We also got a lecture by Lucas Evers about Bio Art. Intrigued by the distinction we (= humans) make between inanimate material - plants – bacteria – vertibrates – other human beings, the work of [Spela Petric](https://www.spelapetric.org/) resonated most with my current questions.

To find out more about this and hopefully get some answers to my questions, I decided to attend the [V2 Meetup Introduction to Bio Art](https://v2.nl/events/media-art-meetup-2-4-introduction-to-bio-art), where both Lucas and Spela would be speakers.

This week’s device to be built was the incubator. Important part of an incubator: temperature sensing and adjusting temperature accordingly.

I breadboarded the electronics and after some initial problems all seemed to work fine. Together with Candyce the wooden enclosure was lasercut and put together. Next step to do: convert breadboarded version into soldered one and mount  everything in the enclosure. 

Thinking about a possible Final Project  (designing a game for a micro-organism seemed a logical next step after having designed games for humans and for machines) I started reading about/ watching videos about [programmable plants](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151116112702.htm), [the rights of microbes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/030801804225012635?journalCode=yisr20), [using micro-organisms in games](https://vimeo.com/261943628) and other related subjects.

A whole new world is opening up for me!



##  Week 2


![](/images/MIN-MAX%20thermometer.jpg "MIN-MAX thermometer" )

This week we got an introduction on microbiology and analog electronics. The assignment for electronics was to make a circuit with input and output. For this I revived an Arduino-device I designed for my [Non-Scientific Arctic Weather Station](https://www.facebook.com/inger.legue/posts/10155048045464335) in Ísafjörður, Iceland (2017):  a MIN-MAX thermometer including an LCD display.

In the lab we got an introduction on cultivating microbes. We learned about (a) nutrient agar and (b) agar plates, and about (c) incubators and (d) autoclaves, aka Ikea pressure cookers.
 

![](/images/Week2_Composite2.jpg "Working sterile")

For cultivating microbes working sterile to avoid contamination is very important: (a) use alcohol to clean the surface and (b) a gas burner to create a sterile umbrella and for next steps: (c) sterilize whatever  you use and (d) stay within the sterile “umbrella”. 


![](/images/IMG_E1154.JPG "Magnetic Stirre Electronics")
For this week’s device (the magnetic stirrer) I ordered all parts and assembled the electronics. I found out the resistors got really hot while the heating pad did hardly heat up. Even after changing the power supply the problem remained.


![](/images/IMG_1188.PNG "Revised Magnetic Stirrer circuit")
It appeared to be a flaw in the design. The fix was to add 3 resistors in parallel and to move one of the connections, as can be seen in this updated schedule posted by Raza, a [2017 BHA student](https://github.com/R4za/BiohackAcademy2017/blob/master/stirrerschematic.png ). After changing the circuit accordingly the heating pad functioned as expected.

##  Week 1



![](/images/UVlight.JPG  "UVlight" )
This first day we reflected on what biohacking is and what the Biohack Academy stands for. We got an introduction to Sketchup for 3D design, which I do not intend to use since I prefer Fusion360 because it allows for parametric design. Per Staugaard (BVF Biosafety officer) taught us how to behave safely in the lab and showed us, using UV light, that even washing hands is not trivial and needs more attention than if everyday life.

Each week we will build a device to use in a DIY lab. This week we built our first lab device: a [sterile hood](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_SterileHood). Again: quite a challenge, in particular because Ikea changed the design of the extractor fan we used as a primary filter!

![](/images/IMG_0839_klein.jpg "Sterile Hood" )

In the lab we learned the basics of working sterile using alcohol to clean the working surface and a gas burner to create a sterile ”umbrella”.

![](/images/photo%201.JPG "Sterile Umbrella" )

We also got an introduction to laser cutting, this week’s practical assignment being the design and fabrication of a laser cut tube rack. I designed a parametric rack in Fusion 360, the parameters being the number of rows, number of columns and the tube size per row.

##  Biohack Academy 2019: My first blog post ever

I feel really blessed to have the opportunity to be part of the [6th Biohack Academy](https://waag.org/en/article/sixth-ibiohack-academy-planned-2019) that will take place in the next 10 weeks in this beautiful building in Amsterdam: 




![](/images/IMG_1357_klein.jpg "Waag, Amsterdam" )


In this blog I will document what I learn and discover as a newbie biohacker. 
To start with: I will have to learn how to resize and rotate a picture in this blog!

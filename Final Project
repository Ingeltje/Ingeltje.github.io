##  FINAL PROJECT 

“Resistence is fertile”: this was the title of my final project’s midterm presentation. 
Surprised by the complete lack of empathy for the [seedling](

sent to the backside of the moon by China’s Chang'e 4 lander, perishing there from cold a few hours after it sprouted ….

…. as opposed to the commotion there was in the 50s about the stray dog Laika, sent into orbit around Earth by the Russians and dying in Spoetnik 2 after 7 hours from heat and stress ….

…  I wanted to take a closer look into the distance humans apparantly perceive between themselves and other biological agents. 
Since “having brains” seemed to be a key factor for that perceived distance and hence for the level of empathy towards those other biological agents, I thought showing “brain-like” activity in thought-off "brainless" entities  - like for instance iceberg lettuce - perhaps could change the perceived distance and make people feel more related to for instance iceberg lettuce ….

 … that, visually, already shows a remarkable resemblance to the human brain:

A common way of measuring brain activity being to make an EEG, my plan was to hook up iceberg lettuce to an EEG device and compare potential difference under changing test conditions (neutral environment – sound of cutting iceberg lettuce – video of someone eating iceberg lettuce), comparable to doing EEG experiments with humans.

There were still some experimental design issues to be solved, but having built EEG-based BCI systems before, I was sure I would know how to do this and presented my Resistence is fertile  project at midterm:

And then, while presenting it, I realized I indeed already knew how to do this! That was not why I joined Biohack Academy! Lucky for me Roland sympathized with my plan to completely change subject, so what follows is my Final Project version 2.0.

## Final Project version 2.0: Inger’s Kitchen Sink Lab

### Project description: 
Inger's Kitchen Sink Lab consists of a prototypical kitchen sink bio lab for both biological experiments and - in parallel -  the development of  ideas about the technical, legal and ethical questions involved in biological experiments (including genetically modification of the human genome), reformulated  as “Kan ik het”, “Mag ik het” and “Wil ik het”.

### Context:
While the WHO and other national and international organizations are discussing standards for governance of intervention on the human genome, November 2018 [Dr. He Jiankui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Jiankui) (Shenzhen, China),
claimed to have made the first genetically modified people, using CRISPR Cas9 to genetically modify the genome.

March 2017 [COGEM](https://www.cogem.net/index.cfm/en), the Dutch committee that provides scientific advice to the government on the risks to human health and the environment of the production and use of GMOs and informs the government of ethical and societal issues linked to genetic modification, published [“Ingrijpen in het DNA van de mens”](https://www.cogem.net/index.cfm/nl/publicaties/publicatie/ingrijpen-in-het-dna-van-de-mens-morele-en-maatschappelijke-implicaties-van-kiembaanmodificatie).

Triggered by Dr. He’s announcement, January 2019 COGEM [updated](https://www.cogem.net/index.cfm/nl/publicaties/publicatie/update-ingrijpen-in-het-dna-van-de-mens) this publication, stating that the discussion has been accelerated and expressing concerns about the technical, legal and ethical questions that are associated with genetically modification of the human genome.

Being a human being myself, I consider the subject too important to leave it to COGEM, de Gezondheidsraad, WHO or other organizations to come up with answers.  My modus operandi being that I build and do to find out and explore, I decided to start doing my own research about the blessings and dangers of genetically modification of genomes in general and the human one in particular, by building a prototypical Kitchen Sink Bio Lab (aka the IKS Lab, short for Inger's Kitchen Sink Lab) and start experimenting while in parallel developing ideas about the technical, legal and ethical questions involved, reformulated  as “Kan ik het”, “Mag ik het” and “Wil ik het”, using the IKS Lab grid as a canvas:
